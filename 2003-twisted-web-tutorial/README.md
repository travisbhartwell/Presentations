# Twisted Web: A Tutorial

Talk was given at PyCon DC 2003, about using [Twisted Web](https://docs.twisted.org/en/stable/web/index.html) from the [Twisted Python framework](https://twisted.org).

## Slides

The slides can be found [here](./slides), with the source [here](./slides/tw-deploy), and rendered slides [here](./slides/slides).

They were created using the [slides.py](slides.py) CGI renderer included here.

The original slide source was copied from the Twisted project where I originally committed them, most recently found [at this commit](https://github.com/twisted/twisted/tree/915c248d0fbd53253b0a84368236d3b293de7396/docs/historic/2003/pycon/tw-deploy).

## Published Slides

I published the slides online on my website, which can be found on [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20081010235521/http://www.travishartwell.net/pycon2003/tw_deploy-01.html).
