# PyGtk and PyGnome Programming

This talk was about using the Python bindings for [gtk](https://www.gtk.org) and [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org) for doing GUI programming.

I gave this talk at two different conferences in 2004:
- At PyCon DC 2004.
- At Utah State University's Free Software and Linux Club (FSLC) [Free Software and Linux Forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20040624070545/http://www.fslc.usu.edu/forum2004/)
