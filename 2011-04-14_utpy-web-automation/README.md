# Web Automation with Python

Talk given at the [Utah Python Users's Group](https://utahpython.org/) on April 14, 2011.

Included here is a [PDF version of the slides](presentation.pdf).

## Examples

Examples shared in the talk are in the [examples directory](examples/).

## Meta

The [slides](presentation.rst) are written in [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) and are generated using [rst2beamer](https://agapow.net/software/rst2beamer/), wired together using the [SCons](https://scons.org) build tool.

I wrote my own presentation software found in [utilities](../utilities) that I used to display the PDF and that posted an image of each slide to Twitter as it was shown.
