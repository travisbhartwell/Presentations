# Free Software and Linux Club Presentations

During my time at [Utah State University](https://www.usu.edu), I gave several presentations and workshops on a variety of subjects for the Free Software and Linux Club ([FSLC](https://web.archive.org/web/20040624070545/http://www.fslc.usu.edu/)), of which I was also a founder and officer. I no longer have the dates of when these occurred, but these were roughly between 1999 and 2004.

I still have the slides for the them, so they are included here.

## The Emacs Text Editor Workshop

I gave a workshop on using the [Emacs Text Editor](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

The HTML version of the slides can be found [here](emacs.html).

## Python: A Good Tool for Many Tasks

I gave a presentation in conjunction with a fellow student, David Mortensen, on the Python programming language.

The slides can be found on [archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20011118105803/https://fslc.usu.edu/wp/display/22/).
