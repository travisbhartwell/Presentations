* What is it?

Spacemacs is a new way to experience Emacs -- a sophisticated and
polished set-up focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.

          - Community-driven configuration
          - Configurable, switchable at run-time, key bindings in:
            - vim style
            - Emacs style
            - hybrid
          - Important functionality exposed via "Leader" keys

* Installing Spacemacs

         - Minimum requirements: Emacs 24.4 and git

         - See https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs#prerequisites
           for platform specific requirements

         - Quick and easy:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

* Updating Spacmacs

          - Development is in the =develop= branch

          - Periodic releases are done to the =master= branch
          - If running a release, Spacemacs will check for new
            releases on start

          - Easy command to update / roll back Emacs packages
            from the *Spacemacs Home Buffer* (~SPC b h~)

          - Keep the development branch up to date either using
            =magit= or the git CLI.

* Configuring Spacemacs

          - Instead of =~/.emacs= or =~/.emacs.d/init.el=, use
            =~/.spacemacs= or =~/.spacemacs.d/init.el=

          - It's based on a template with options for common
            configuration items

          - To compare your configuration with the current
            template, use ~SPC f e D~.  Always do this after
            doing updates so you get the latest settings.

* Emacs concepts and terminology

          - buffer, window, frame, minibuffer, modeline
          - major and minor mode
          - interactive functions
          - key notation ~SPC~, ~C-c C-c~, etc

* Spacemacs Conventions (Leader Key)

          - Much general funtionality under the leader
            ~SPC~ or ~M-m~
          - Mode-specific functionality under ~SPC m~, ~M-m m~
            or ',', ~C-M-m~
          - Usually with mnemonics, for example:
            ~SPC t n~ for *T*oggle line *n*umbering

          - All incomplete key combinations documented with
            =which-key=

* Getting help in Spacemacs

          - In general under ~SPC h~
          - Evil tutor: ~SPC h T~
          - Spacemacs Help: ~SPC h SPC~
          - Various =describe-= options, including
            - describe variable: ~SPC h d v~
            - describe function: ~SPC h d f~

* Layers

Composable groups of related packages, configuration, and
functionality are found in Spacemacs *Layers*.

          - You use a layer by adding it to
            =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= in your
            =.spacemacs= file.

          - Check the documentation for the specific layers for
            any external, non-Emacs dependencies

          - Either restart Emacs or hit ~SPC f e R~ to reload.
